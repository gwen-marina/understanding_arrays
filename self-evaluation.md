I feel okay with the content on Arrays, so far. I'm not 100% on it, but like the lesson said, I will memorize the ones I'll use most often, and then search/look for information on the ones I don't.

I think I might need to learn more about booleans before moving on the next lesson. I don't know why these sort of trip me up. I would like to have the GitHub lesson as well, or maybe even a recording to watch on my own time. I know there has to be some additional learning I could use, but I can't think of anything else right now.  

I don't currently have any questions about Arrays. I think the booleans trip me up a bit because it's true/false and it just seems to be more abstract. Strings are so defined, but booleans seem a little more out there.
